# Architecture

Minho has been designed with simplicity and user/developer focus in mind.

Minho architecture is service module oriented at core.

The Minho boot component is responsible of:

* the main Service Registr hosting services provided by modules
* the Minho core services
* the Minho service loader to register additional services in your runtime
