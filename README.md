# Apache Karaf

This is a repository heading to Karaf 5.

The purpose is to address the following points:

* new clean project structure (core, extensions, ...)
* core with a Main easy to embed/bootstrap and optimized startup
* new tool to easily create applications on Karaf (including Karaf annotations)
* new tool to simplify testing in Karaf
* new tool to simplify assembly/packaging
* new tool (plugins) to "convert" existing applications (spring boot, microprofiles) into an Karar compliant artifact (and eventually override some beans/services)
* new resources manager allowing to partition/assign resources to applications in Karaf
