# Tools

K5 provides several tools in order for you to easily create your runtime.

Basically, K5 tools can use `karaf-build.json` file describing the runtime.

Then, you can create different forms (distributions) for your runtime:

* `package` creates a directory containing all required resources for the runtime (exploded form). Then, you go in this directory and just launch the runtime with `java -jar karaf-boot-xx.jar`
* `jar` creates an uber jar packaging runtime resources in one archive. Then, you launch the runtime with `java -jar myruntime.jar`
* `archive` creates a zip archive containing runtime resources and startup script. After extracting this archive, you can launch the runtime with `./bin/karaf.sh`

You have different options to create the runtime.

## `karaf-build.json` file

All K5 tools are using a runtime descriptor: `karaf-build.json`.

This file describe:

* `name` of the runtime
* `properties` used to specify extra information to build the runtime
* `dependencies` is the modules (libraries) to be included in the runtime (using `file`, `http`, `mvn` URL)

Here's an example of `karaf-build.json` file:

```json
{
	"name": "my-runtime",
	"properties": {
		"include.transitive": "true"
	},
	"dependencies": [
		"k5:karaf-boot",
		"mvn:commons-lang/commons-lang/2.6"
	]
}
```

_NB: `karaf-build.json` can be written by hand or can be generated by the `karaf-maven-plugin` for instance._

## CLI

`karaf-build` is a command line to create the runtime based on `karaf-build.json` descriptor.
